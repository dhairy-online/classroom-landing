We will describe our wensite and what it does here.
---------------------------------------------------

Parts of this website:

1. HTML and CSS --> easy and you know it already.
2. Javascript --> also easy but we need to use it more.
3. Fonts and other shit --> lol that's ssuper easy.

So how to send emails using HTML and JS?
Answer: You cannot. We will have to use a SERVER instead.
